# Security Policy

We are committed to maintaining the security and integrity of all products and services developed by The Basho Collective S.A.S. We value the input of security researchers and the community in helping us keep our systems safe.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

DO NOT submit security issues via public GitHub Issues, discussions, or general support channels.

To report a vulnerability, please send a detailed, private report directly to our security team.

### Reporting Channel

Email: siliconmoksha@proton.me

### Required Information

To help us triage and prioritize the finding quickly, please include the following:

- Vulnerability Description: A clear explanation of the issue.
- Affected Component(s): The specific repository, application, or service URL.
- Proof of Concept (PoC): Step-by-step instructions or code to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Impact: How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?

## Our Commitments

When you report a security issue to us privately, we commit to:

- Acknowledge your report within 3 business days.
- Confirm the vulnerability and provide a timeline for remediation within 10 business days.
- Keep you informed of the progress toward fixing the issue.
- Credit you publicly for your responsible disclosure (if you agree).

## Scope

This policy applies to all proprietary codebases, public-facing applications, and API services owned and operated by The Basho Collective S.A.S.

If you are reporting a security issue in a third-party library or framework we use, please report it to the maintainers of that project first, and then notify us so we can track the dependency update.

This policy is reviewed annually by The Basho Collective S.A.S Corporate Security.
